**Project: Stock Trend Prediction Web App**
- Developed a dynamic Stock Trend Prediction Web App using Python and Streamlit, allowing users to analyze and predict stock trends in real time.
- Utilized machine learning algorithms to process historical stock data and generate predictions, providing users with insights into potential market movements.
- Designed an intuitive user interface that enables users to easily input stock symbols, adjust prediction parameters, and visualize historical and predicted stock trends through interactive charts.
- Implemented data visualization using libraries like Matplotlib and Plotly to provide users with a clear representation of stock trends, helping them make informed decisions.
- Integrated external APIs to fetch real-time stock data and news updates using yfinance, enhancing the app's ability to provide up-to-date information to users.
- Leveraged Streamlit's capabilities for rapid prototyping and deployment, resulting in a user-friendly web app that doesn't require prior web development experience.
